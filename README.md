## Possible Improvements

- Configuration file

- Customize the parameters: Timeout, retry a certain number of times before giving up, etc

- Parallel Cloning: Right now, the program clones repositories one by one. If we are dealing with a large number of repositories, this might be time-consuming. We could potentially speed this up by cloning repositories in parallel using threads.
