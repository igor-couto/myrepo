**myrepo** is a command-line tool written in Rust that allows users to search for theirs GitHub repositories by name. It also provides optional functionality to clone any found repositories. Simple, efficient, and easy to use, this tool is a valuable addition to any developer's toolkit.

## Features

- Search for GitHub repositories by a substring in their names.
- Optionally clone the repositories that are found.

## Installation

To clone repositories, make sure you have Git installed. If not, follow the instructions [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Usage
```bash
myrepo <substring_to_search> [-c | --clone]
```

`<substring_to_search>` is the substring you want to search for in the repository names.

If you want to clone the repositories that are found, include the `-c` or `--clone` flag.

## Examples
To search for repositories containing "rust":

```bash
myrepo rust
```

To search for and clone repositories containing "rust":

```bash
myrepo rust -c
```

## Possible Improvements

- Configuration file

- Customize the parameters: Timeout, retry a certain number of times before giving up, etc

- Parallel Cloning: Right now, the program clones repositories one by one. If we are dealing with a large number of repositories, this might be time-consuming. We could potentially speed this up by cloning repositories in parallel using threads.
