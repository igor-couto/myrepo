This is a command-line tool written in Rust that searches for yours GitHub repositories by a substring. It can also clone the repositories it finds.

## Features

- Search for GitHub repositories by a substring in their names.
- Optionally clone the repositories that are found.

## Installation

To clone repositories, make sure you have Git installed. If not, follow the instructions [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

ðŸš§-ðŸš§-ðŸš§

## Usage
```bash
myrepo <substring_to_search> [-c | --clone]
```

`<substring_to_search>` is the substring you want to search for in the repository names.

If you want to clone the repositories that are found, include the `-c` or `--clone` flag.

## Examples
To search for repositories containing "rust":

```bash
myrepo rust
```

To search for and clone repositories containing "rust":

```bash
myrepo rust -c
```

## Possible Improvements

- Configuration file

- Customize the parameters: Timeout, retry a certain number of times before giving up, etc

- Parallel Cloning: Right now, the program clones repositories one by one. If we are dealing with a large number of repositories, this might be time-consuming. We could potentially speed this up by cloning repositories in parallel using threads.
